Code for CS 1050 (Computer Science I), Fall 2020 

This repository has code shared with my students in CS 1050 (Computer Science I), Fall 2020, at MSU Denver. This is the first course in the computer science core sequence.  Students learn a modern programming language and the basic skills needed to analyze problems and construct programs for their solutions.  The emphasis of the course is on the techniques of algorithm development, correctness, and programming style.  Students are also introduced to the fundamentals of software engineering and the software-development life cycle.
